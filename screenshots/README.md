## Main menu

![WalletWorker Main Menu](./main.jpg)

Here we see the main menu with the main features available with this wallet interface.  I call this a wallet interface because at its core it is simply exposing API features from komodod in a set of menus.

## Asset Chains Menu

![WalletWorker Asset Chains](./assetchains.jpg)

You can select any Komodo asset chain and adding new ones are as easily done by adding a new entry to acs.txt

## View all addresses in your wallet

![WalletWorker List Addresses](./listaddresses.jpg)

The komodod API provides a few different ways to view addresses in your wallet most of which are exposed here.

![WalletWorker Create Addresses](./createaddress.jpg)

Quickly generate a new Transparent or Private address for your wallet!

![WalletWorker Wallet Backup](./backup.jpg)

Backup your wallet files to a few key locations on your system. The files will be automatically labeled and timestamped so keeping multiple backups is super simple.

![WalletWorker Private Keys Menu](./privkeys.jpg)

Control your private keys! Export, Import or Dump them all to a text file if you really want.
